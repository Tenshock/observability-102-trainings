## Getting started

Go to the first commit and follow step by step the correction following commits.

> Hints: Hands-on instructions are listed below, the current commit instruction is highlighted. Also, commits messages references the instructions numbering with a command to go to next commit.

## Instructions

1. create a new `.NET` Solution.
2. Add a .NET Class Library `Greetings` exposing one class `Greetings` with one async method `SayHi`.
3. Add an ASP .NET web API `Greetings.Api` with a endpoint `/hello-world` calling `SayHi`.
4. Make sure everything works with a little `curl`.
5. For the web API
    1. Instrument the ASP .NET framework for metrics.
    2. Add a custom metric on the `hello-world` endpoint.
    3. Instrument the ASP .NET framework for tracing.
    4. Add a custom span wrapping `SayHi` call.
6. For the Class Library
    1. Add one log on `SayHi` following the `ILogger` interface. Run the app, see the console output with your new log.
    2. **Disable the default Logger Providers in `Greetings.Api`. Run the app, it should work without logging spawning. <- YOU ARE HERE** âœ…
    3. Configure an OTL Logger Provider, run the app and check the console.

## Correction

1. In the `Greetings.Api` package, disable Logging Providers, see [Logging providers in .NET](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logging-providers)
2. `dotnet run --project Greetings.Api`
3. `curl localhost:<port>/hello-world` and watch the console, you should see a log without more metadata.
